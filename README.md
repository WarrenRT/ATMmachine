   <h1> Description </h1>
    <p>It is a react app that allows users to add and subtract the value from the account in each session.
I made improvements to the look of the app by adding styling to the links and organizing the features in a table.
I added a feature that creates and alert box when a user tries to withdraw more money than the account currently holds.</p>
